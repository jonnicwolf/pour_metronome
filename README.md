# Pour Metronome

A brief description of what this project does and who it's for

Introducing Pour Metronome, the WatchOS app designed by a bartender for bartenders. This intuitive tool starts a vibrating pulse with a tap, each signaling 1oz or 10ml, perfect for precise pours. Simply tap to start and stop. It's your behind-the-bar precision partner, making every cocktail consistently perfect.
